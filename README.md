## 6. Can you provide examples of how simplifying terms (e.g., "start" instead of "initiate") improves comprehension?
-1. General Actions:

Instead of: "Initiate the process."
Use: "Start the process."
Why it's better: "Start" is a common, everyday word that everyone understands. "Initiate" is more formal and less familiar.
Instead of: "Implement the changes."
Use: "Make the changes." or "Apply the changes."
Why it's better: "Implement" is a business/technical term. "Make" or "apply" are direct and easily grasped.
Instead of: "Utilize the resource."
Use: "Use the resource."
Why it's better: "Utilize" is unnecessarily formal. "Use" is the standard, simple word.
2. Technology/Software:

Instead of: "Execute the program."
Use: "Run the program."
Why it's better: "Run" is the common term used in everyday computer usage. "Execute" is more technical.
Instead of: "Configure the settings."
Use: "Set up the settings." or "Change the settings."
Why it's better: "Configure" is a technical term. "Set up" or "change" are more intuitive.
Instead of: "Deactivate the feature."
Use: "Turn off the feature."
Why it's better: "Deactivate" is formal. "Turn off" is simple and direct.
